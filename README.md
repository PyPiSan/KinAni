## Android Development
KinAni is completely written in Java. Contributions are welcome to migrate the app to Kotlin/Jetpack Compose for better UI. 

## Development Setup
You need to have the latest [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to be able to build the app.
Just clone the main branch for the latest codebase.

## API Keys
You do not need any API/Client keys for the various services.
The API endpoint documentation will be posted here soon.
For Ad-free uses, you can request an ad-free API key or build the app without the ad integration.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, this is a just-for-fun project and the TV version is also in progress. Any help would be appreciated. I do not own any contents of the app.

For non-developers, if you find an error in the app, please raise an issue.
